The event will only fire when the element comes in to view of the viewport, and out of viewport. It won't keep triggering element remains in view or not in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    <div on-viewport=\"someFunc\">Lorem Ipsum...</div>\r\n  \r\n    ractiveObj.on('someFunc', function(event){\r\n       event.original.current // Current state\r\n       event.original.previous // Previous state\r\n       event.original.visible // same as event.original.current\r\n    });\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nAn interval in the background checks for the position of the bounding rectangle of element against the viewport dimensions and the parent's scroll position. If it detects any change in view state, it triggers an event on element.\r\n\r\n### Browser Compatibility\r\nBrowsers that support getBoundingClientRect().","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
